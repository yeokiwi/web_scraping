The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) is the national regulator of business entities, public accountants and corporate service providers in Singapore.

**Page Last Updated Status:** The page contains content with various dates. The most recent date found is **2025/12/08**. Based on a current date assumption, this date is in the future and not within one month prior to today. Therefore, **the page is NOT last updated one month from the current date**.

# Practice Monitoring Programme and Quality Control Reviews

**Page Last Updated Status:** The page is **NOT** last updated within one month from the current date. The visible update date in the footer is "2024/09/09".

## Practice Monitoring Programme (PMP)

The PMP involves the following steps:

Public accountants that do not audit listed companies are generally inspected by practice reviewers employed by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (“ISCA”) and appointed by the PAOC. The reports from these inspections are submitted to the PMSC and PAOC as with all other PMP inspection reports.

## Quality Control (QC) Reviews

The QC review involves the following steps:

The PAOC (Firm Level) decides on the review outcome and, if it concludes that the AE’s compliance with the quality control standards is either (i) partially satisfactory; or (ii) not satisfactory, orders the AE to undertake remedial actions or makes other orders to protect the public interest.

## Audit Regulatory Reports

The Practice Monitoring Programme (PMP) is an important regulatory instrument in promoting audit quality. Audit quality is the cornerstone of market confidence in the reliability of the financial information upon which the market makes capital allocation decisions.

The PMP provides quality assurance to the market through ascertaining whether public accountants have complied with the prescribed auditing standards, methods, procedures and other requirements. This assurance gives users of financial reports increased confidence in audit opinions.

With effect from 1 July 2023, ACRA's inspection powers were expanded to include quality control review on accounting entities, so that audit firms will deliver consistent high audit quality.

The Audit Regulatory Reports are available.

# Audit Regulation in Singapore

ACRA registers public accountants, monitors their work, publishes information about audit quality in Singapore and works with partners in the profession and the business community to strengthen the financial reporting eco-system.

## Registration
**Ensuring that public accountants are prepared for the responsibilities of an auditor**

The main reason for registering as a public accountant is so that a person can provide public accountancy services such as audit and reporting on financial statements in Singapore. A public accountant is responsible for the issuance of audit opinions, and this responsibility includes ensuring that audits are conducted in accordance with the professional standards (i.e. Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs) and/or other requirements).

Registration as a public accountant is also necessary for performing other acts that are required by law to be done by a public accountant, such as appointment as a judicial manager under the Accountants Act.

There is no need to register as a public accountant to provide other accountancy services in Singapore, such as accounting, tax and corporate advisory work.

To register as a public accountant, ACRA requires applicants to have:

## Monitoring
**Ensuring that public accountants base their audit opinions on sufficient and appropriate work and audit evidence**

Registered public accountants must adhere to the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, keep up to date technically through continuing professional education and have their audit work inspected under ACRA’s Practice Monitoring Programme (PMP).

Under the PMP, ACRA inspects audits performed by public accountants to check if they have complied with the professional standards (i.e. SSAs¹ and/or other requirements²).

For accounting entities, ACRA assesses the quality controls (QC reviews) of such entities against the Singapore Standards on Quality Management (SSQM 1 and SSQM 2)³.

## ACRA's Audit Quality Indicator Disclosure Framework
To enable Audit Committees of listed companies to better evaluate and select the right auditor, ACRA has introduced an Audit Quality Indicator (AQI) Disclosure Framework.

The AQI framework comprises 7 quality markers, which includes involvement of audit team members during each audit phase, years of audit experience and industry specialisation of audit team members as well as results from internal and external inspections of auditors.

## Working with partners to promote high quality audit
Many groups contribute to audit quality in addition to auditors, especially directors, preparers of financial statements and investors. To foster a strong eco-system that promotes audit quality, ACRA works with partners in the profession and the business community in a concerted effort to provide help to public accountants, and educate business people about their roles in the audit process as well as the value of a good audit.

## The Singapore CA Qualification and the Accountant of Today

*Singapore’s national chartered accountant qualification is internationally recognised and offers an Asian perspective.*

Accountants are business leaders in demand anywhere in the world. They have more than just technical knowledge. They have multi-disciplinary skill sets, come from a diversity of academic backgrounds, and provide high value-adding specialised services. With an international outlook, they provide holistic business advice and are the financial backbone of a company. In short, they are trusted advisors, critical to the success of a business.

The Singapore CA Qualification is designed to develop these business leaders.

**Singapore’s national Chartered Accountant qualification**

The Singapore CA Qualification is the national CA qualification. It was developed by the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) in 2013. Upon completion of the programme, candidates can apply for full membership at the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) to be conferred the designation, Singapore Chartered Accountant. The Singapore CA Qualification is globally recognised and internationally portable.

# Audit Quality Indicators and Industry Average

## Highlights
*Raising the Quality of Audits and Financial Reporting in Singapore*

Audit plays a crucial role in raising the quality and reliability of a company’s financial disclosure to investors. Appointing the right auditor who can act as an effective and independent gatekeeper is crucial to protecting the interests of investors.

Audit Committees (AC) play a key role in evaluating and selecting the right auditor for listed companies. There is however limited information available for ACs to measure and evaluate the quality of an audit. Thus, differentiating and selecting the audit firm best suited to the size and complexity of a company can be a difficult task.

In October 2015, ACRA introduced an Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs) Disclosure Framework to help ACs of listed companies better evaluate and select the right auditor. The AQI Disclosure Framework comprises comparable quality markers that correlate closely with audit quality. In August 2016, to further enhance the use of AQIs, ACRA introduced six targets on selected AQIs to provide ACs with a common yardstick for comparison and to facilitate meaningful audit quality conversations with the auditors.

As part of ongoing efforts to raise audit quality, ACRA regularly monitors the effectiveness of the AQI Disclosure Framework and its relevance to ACs. Following a detailed review which included extensive consultations with audit firms and ACs, ACRA has revised the AQI Disclosure Framework, taking into account feedback from audit firms and ACs, to ensure that the indicators can better meet the needs of the ACs. The revised Framework and changes are summarised below:

**1. Revisions to the ACRA’s AQIs Disclosure Framework**

| Original AQIs in Framework | What has changed? | Revised AQIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Audit hours – *Time spent by senior team members* | To include breakdown of hours incurred by the audit engagement team by grade and by the various audit phases (e.g. planning, fieldwork and completion)<br>*Rationale: To track achievement of milestones and to assess the timeliness of auditor involvement* | Audit hours – Involvement of audit team members during each audit phase |
| Quality Control – *Headcount of partners and managers in quality control functions* | To include total headcount of quality control personnel and to present in relative terms as a ratio of total audit staff headcount | Quality Control – Headcount of partners, managers and professional staff in quality control functions and comparison vis-à-vis audit staff strength |
| Independence – *Compliance with independence requirements* | Removed from framework<br>Rationale: Firms are already declaring their independence to their audit clients under the relevant professional standards (e.g. ACRA's Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics) | |
| Training – *Average training hours and industry specific training* | No change | |
| Inspections – *Results of External and Internal Inspections* | No change | |
| Staff oversight – *Staff per partner / manager ratios* | No change | |
| Experience – *Years of audit experience and industry specialisation* | No change | |
| Attrition rate – *Degree of personnel losses* | No change | |

**2. Disclosure of industry average and range for relevant AQIs**

In place of the AQI targets introduced in 2016, ACRA will instead provide relevant information on industry average and range for the audit firms in the listed companies segment (categorised by Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms), to better facilitate industry comparison:

| AQIs | Industry information |
| :--- | :--- |
| Staff oversight – *Staff per partner / manager ratio* | Partner to Audit professional staff and Manager leverage ratio<br>Manager to Audit professional staff leverage ratio |
| Experience – *Years of audit experience and industry specialisation* | Average years of experience (by grade) |
| Attrition rate – *Degree of personnel losses* | Staff attrition rate (overall) |

The industry information will be updated every half-yearly and annually, and published on the ACRA website as follows:

| Duration | Published on ACRA website |
| :--- | :--- |
| 6 months period ending 31 Mar | 30 Jun |
| 12 months period ending 30 Sep | 31 Dec |

The revised AQI Disclosure Framework is available for voluntary adoption by audit firms for audits of financial statements of listed entities in Singapore for periods ending on or after 31 March 2020. Audit firms are encouraged to adopt the revised AQI Disclosure Framework early, and to share the AQI data with the ACs so as to ensure meaningful analysis and discussion.

The IDP focuses on three core strategies:
1.  Enhancing digital skills and knowledge.
2.  Promoting the adoption of technology.
3.  Developing accounting technology and innovations.

A key component is the Digital Roadmap, which advises SMPs on which digital solutions to adopt and what employee training to undertake at each stage of their digital development.

## About the Accounting Standards Committee

With the passing of the Accountancy Functions (Consolidation) Act 2022, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), the Council, and the Singapore Accountancy Commission merged under one entity (ACRA) with effect from 1 April 2023. The Act conferred the function of making or formulation of accounting standards for companies, charities, co-operative societies and societies on ACRA and reconstituted the Council as the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) under ACRA, to continue performing the function of making or formulation of accounting standards in the same way as the Council had done. The Act also provided for any accounting standards made or formulated or deemed to have been made or formulated, and any practice directions issued or deemed to have been issued, by the Council before 1 April 2023, and which have not been revoked before that date, to continue in force after that date as if made or formulated or issued by the ASC after that date. The merger would strengthen the effectiveness of regulation, standard-setting, and sector development by harnessing synergies across complementary functions, and strengthen ACRA's ability to develop and manage talent in a sustained manner.

**Chartered Valuer and Appraiser Programme , Institute of Valuers and Appraisers, ACRA**

Established under the umbrella of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), the Institute of Valuers and Appraisers, Singapore (IVAS) seeks to foster professional excellence in the areas of Business Valuation and develop Singapore into a Centre of Excellence for Business Valuation.

Through these initiatives, IVAS will seek to broaden the talent pool, deepen the expertise of Business Valuation professionals, uphold the public trust in the role they perform and enhance the reputation of the Business Valuation profession in the region.

In 2016, IVAS launched Asia's first professional Business Valuation certification, the Chartered Valuer and Appraiser programme. IVAS also develops competency frameworks and promotes professional valuation standards.

IVAS is a member of the International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC), the global standard setter for valuation.

## Demand for Business Valuation

Business Valuation is the process of determining the value of businesses, securities and assets including financial, tangible and intangible assets. It is an area that is rapidly gaining prominence in Singapore and in Asia. The Singapore Government’s Committee on the Future Economy’s (CFE) Working Group on Legal and Accounting Services has identified Business Valuation as one of the nine high growth areas. Demand for Business Valuation services is coming from:

*   the rise in merger and acquisition (M&A) activities;
*   Singapore’s growth as a centre for litigation proceedings and arbitration;
*   growing importance of intellectual property in business; and,
*   the use of fair value measurement in the financial reporting framework.

## Need for Business Valuation services in the corporate environment

A wide range of professions would require Business Valuation expertise when handling work in areas such as Financial Reporting, Transactions, and Litigation and Arbitration.

## IVAS Council

The IVAS Council oversees all initiatives by IVAS and comprises industry practitioners from a wide variety of backgrounds, all dedicated to serving high standards of ethics and professionalism for Business Valuation standards in Singapore.

## Page 25: https://www.acra.gov.sg/announcements/trustbar (Depth: 1)
# New trustBar verification service provides added assurance on authenticity of ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates

ACRA has launched a new verification service to give added assurance to businesses and the public using ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration) when conducting business and making business decisions.

Over 75,000 Business Profiles and Business certificates (Incorporation/Registration) are issued by ACRA each month. They are used for various business-related activities where verification of key information on the business and the people involved are needed.

## Giving assurance on the authenticity of ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates
ACRA's trust*Bar* verification service enables quick and easy verification of the authenticity of ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration).

The service leverages the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)'s OpenAttestation (OA) - an open-source framework for the endorsement and verification of documents.

## New Certification Feature for Business Profile
ACRA's Business Profiles have also been enhanced with a new certification feature (bearing ACRA’s stamp and ACRA Assistant Registrar’s name and signature) with no change to its purchase fee of $5.50. With this enhancement, customers will no longer need to purchase the information product “Business Profile with Certificate of Production” which costs $16.50. Hence, the “Business Profile with Certificate of Production” will be discontinued from 4 March 2023.

## Verification API Service for mass verification purposes
A verification API service will also be offered.

## How trust*Bar* works
From 4 March 2023, each Business Profile and Business Certificate (Incorporation/Registration) issued by ACRA will come in two formats – a Portable Document Format (PDF) file for viewing and an OA file for product verification.

| Verification Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Verification Method 1**<br> Scan the QR code located at the lower right-hand corner of the PDF document. This will direct you to the verification result in the trust*Bar* portal. | (Image: Verify - Scan QR) |
| **Verification Method 2**<br> Enter the verification URL found in the PDF document into an internet browser to access the verification result in the trust*Bar* portal. | (Image: Verify - Access URL) |
| **Verification Method 3**<br> Upload the OA file at the ACRA trust*Bar* portal to view the verification result. | (Image: Verify - Upload OA) |

**Verification of the PDF document**
If the document is verified to be issued by ACRA, the results will show a green tick; and if the document is not issued by ACRA, the results will show a red cross.

For verification results showing a green tick, the entire Business Profile or Business Certificate will be displayed on screen. Customers can check if the PDF document has been altered by comparing it against the PDF document on the screen. Alternatively, they can request for the OA file from the document sender.

| (Image: Results - Authentic) | (Image: Results - Not issued by ACRA) |
| :--- | :--- |

**Print Verification Results**
Customers can print a copy of the business profile or business certificate, which contains the trust*Bar* watermark, verification date and time as confirmation that documents have been verified through trust*Bar*.

(Image: Print - authentic)

**Other Verification Portals**
Customers can also verify the OA files of the Business Profiles and Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration) at other government verification portals.

## Next Phase of Implementation
ACRA will gradually extend this verification capability to the rest of the business information products (such as other certificates and registers) issued by ACRA.

**New currency feature for Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration)**
From 8 Dec 2023, you can check if the information found in Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration) is up to date.

# Variable Capital Companies

## About Variable Capital Companies (VCC)
The Variable Capital Company (VCC) is a new corporate structure for investment funds constituted under the VCC Act and subsidiary legislation is administered by ACRA. All VCCs must be managed by a Permissible Fund Manager [1]. The anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism obligations of VCCs will come under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

### Some key features of a VCC
*   **Flexibility in capital structure**: A VCC can create and redeem shares without seeking shareholder approval, and pay dividends from capital as well as profits.
*   **Umbrella VCC structure**: A VCC can be set up as a single standalone fund or as an umbrella VCC with multiple sub-funds. Each sub-fund can have different investment objectives and segregated assets and liabilities.
*   **Applicable to both open-ended and closed-end funds**: The VCC structure can be used for both open-ended and closed-end funds [2].

[1] Generally, a VCC will have to be managed by a fund manager which is a licensed fund management company (i.e. a holder of a capital markets services licence for fund management under section 86 of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289)), a registered fund management company (i.e. a corporation exempted from holding a capital markets services licence under paragraph 5(1)(i) of the Second Schedule to the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations) or a person exempted under the Section 99(1)(a), (b), (c), or (d) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) from the requirement to hold a capital markets services licence to carry on business in fund management (i.e. a bank licensed under the Banking Act (Cap. 19), a merchant bank approved under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186), a finance company licensed under the Finance Companies Act (Cap. 108), or a company or cooperative society licensed under the Insurance Act (Cap. 142)).

[2] An open-ended fund allows investors to redeem their investments at their discretion, while a closed-end fund does not permit investors to do so. Closed-end funds also have a fixed number of shares and do not allow new subscriptions after the offering period is over, while open-ended funds are open to new subscriptions by new investors at any time.

# Striking off of companies that failed to file ARs

## Summary

The page details the Registrar's power to strike off companies that fail to file Annual Returns (ARs) for consecutive years. Directors with at least three companies struck off by ACRA within five years face disqualification from holding director positions or managing companies. The disqualification period is three years for a first-time offense and five years for repeat offenses.

The Registrar can also issue a Debarment Order against directors or company secretaries for non-compliance with statutory duties, such as failing to lodge documents for three months or more, preventing them from taking new appointments.

An appeal process exists for directors to contest summonses or penalties related to Annual Returns. Appeals require supporting documents and have a typical processing time of four weeks.

# Overview

ACRA has taken significant steps to advance sustainability reporting in Singapore, in line with the Singapore Green Plan and the global momentum towards consistent and comparable sustainability disclosures.

## Sustainability Reporting Office Established

ACRA set up the Sustainability Reporting Office (SRO) to develop and implement a sustainability reporting and assurance roadmap for Singapore-incorporated companies. The SRO participates in international platforms and actively engages domestic stakeholders, including collaborating with other government agencies to advance sustainability reporting and assurance practices in Singapore. Its focus encompasses policy-making and standards-setting for both sustainability reporting and assurance, while also contributing to thought and practice leadership in the field. The SRO is also responsible for developing ACRA’s own sustainability plans. Through these efforts, the SRO exemplifies ACRA’s commitment to leading by example in this important space.

## Singapore’s Climate Reporting and Assurance Roadmap

In August 2025, ACRA and SGX RegCo

We are committed to supporting companies in their climate reporting journey and will continue to engage our stakeholders as we work out legislative amendments to implement the climate reporting and assurance roadmap.

## Supporting companies through thought leadership

In July 2024, ACRA collaborated with the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) at the National University of Singapore to conduct a study on climate-related disclosures. The findings revealed that larger listed companies, particularly those in carbon-intensive sectors, are making good progress in climate reporting.

The study highlighted best practices in climate-related disclosures from local and overseas companies. It also recommended strategies on how companies can enhance their climate reporting, such as prioritising progress over perfection, making meaningful links to financial reporting, and working towards future-proofing their strategy and business model.

Read the full report:

## Building Capabilities in Sustainability Reporting

ACRA has developed the Sustainability Reporting Body of Knowledge (SR BOK) to guide training providers in developing quality programmes for professionals interested in sustainability reporting. The SR BOK provides a comprehensive framework of essential knowledge areas, covering key global standards such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)’s IFRS S1 *General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information* and IFRS S2 *Climate-related Disclosures*, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

Validated by more than 50 key industry stakeholders, including company preparers, assurance providers, professional bodies and training providers, the SR BOK aims to drive consistency in the depth of sustainability reporting training programmes across different providers. Training providers can refer to the SR BOK to design specialised courses.

## Looking ahead

ACRA will continue to enhance climate reporting and assurance practices in Singapore, including by regularly reviewing standards and engaging with stakeholders so as to ensure our framework remains robust yet practical, aligned with international standards, and tailored to suit the local context.

**Page Last Updated Status:** The page contains a date reference of "2025/02/26" (February 26, 2025) in its footer/side content. As this is a future date from the current perspective, it cannot be used to determine a "last updated" status. No reliable "last updated" date within one month of the current date was found in the main content. Therefore, based on the available information, **the page is NOT confirmed to be last updated one month from the current date.**

## Late Lodgement Penalty for the Late Filing of Annual Return (AR)

Companies are required to file their Annual Returns (ARs) under section 197 of the Companies Act (CA). A late lodgement penalty is imposed when the AR is filed late.

| Requirements | Type of Breach | Type of Penalty | Imposed Against | Length of Default | Penalty Imposed at point of filing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 197** | The AR is lodged late | Late lodgement penalty for the late filing of AR | Company | Within 3 months after the AR filing due date | $300 |
| **Section 197** | The AR is lodged late | Late lodgement penalty of the late filing of AR | Company | More than 3 months after the AR filing due date | $600 |

*Applicable for filing due date on or after 14 January 2022*

**Example**
ABC Company Private Limited’s Financial Year End (FYE) is 31 December 2019. It held its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 29 June 2020 and lodged its AR on 20 August 2020. The company breached section 197 of the CA.

| Requirements | Due Date | AR Lodgement Date | Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 197** | 31 Jul 2020 (FYE + 7 months) | 20 August 2020 | $300 |

*Applicable for FYE on or after 31 Aug 2018*

## Composition Sum

If the AR is not filed after the due date, ACRA may commence enforcement actions and offer composition, in lieu of prosecution, to companies and/or directors. The composition sums are as follows:

| Requirements | Type of Breach | Type of Penalty | Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 175** | The AGM is held late | Composition | A minimum composition sum of $500 |
| **Section 197** | The AR is lodged late | Composition | A minimum composition sum of $500 |

**Example**
XYZ Company Private Limited’s FYE is 31 Dec 2019. It held its AGM on 1 Aug 2020 and lodged its AR on 30 Aug 2020. The company breached section 175 and section 197 of the CA. ACRA may offer composition as follows:

| Requirements | Due Date | AGM Date/Lodgement Date | Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 175** | 30 Jun 2020 (FYE + 6 months) | 1 Aug 2020 | A minimum composition sum of $500 |
| **Section 197** | 31 Jul 2020 (FYE + 7 months) | 30 Aug 2020 | A minimum composition sum of $500 |

*Applicable for FYE on or after 31 Aug 2018*

## Court Prosecution

ACRA may prosecute companies and/or directors that breach statutory obligations in court. If convicted, they may be fined up to a maximum of $5,000 per charge.

A director or company representative must attend court if summoned. Failure to attend may result in a warrant for arrest (for a director) or an *ex parte* hearing (for a company).

The page provides guidance on reserving and registering a business name in Singapore. The process involves choosing a unique name, checking its availability, and registering it through the BizFile+ system.

### Key Steps and Information:

1.  **Choosing a Name:** You must check if a name is already registered using the BizFile+ system. Certain words (like "The", "International", "Pte", "Ltd", ".com", ".sg") are disregarded when assessing if a name is identical to an existing one, making names that differ only by these words unacceptable.
2.  **Registering a Name:** Name registration is done via BizFile+. An approved name is reserved for 120 days. Some applications (e.g., containing words like "school") may be referred to authorities, extending processing time to between 14 and 60 days.
3.  **Business Activity:** During registration, you must specify your business activity using the relevant Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code. Some activities may require additional licenses after registration.

**Note:** The page includes advisory notices about identifying official government websites (.gov.sg, HTTPS) and a scam advisory warning that government officials will never ask for money transfers or bank details over the phone.

# Application for Transfer of Registration - Foreign Corporate Entities

**Guide for foreign corporate entities planning to transfer their registration to Singapore**

## Summary
Foreign corporate entities may now apply to transfer their registration to Singapore (inward re-domiciliation). A foreign corporate entity that re-domiciles to Singapore will become a Singapore company and is required to comply with the Companies Act, just like any other Singapore-incorporated company. Re-domiciliation will not affect the obligations, liabilities, properties or rights of the foreign corporate entity.

## How to apply?
You may wish to first conduct a search via Bizfile to find out if the proposed company name is available prior to submitting your application. Prior to the Transfer of Registration application being approved for submission, the company should reserve the proposed name indicated in the application form, to ensure the availability of this name for the Transfer of Registration application.

To apply for transfer of registration, complete the application and make payment via BizFile.

You will need to submit in PDF format the following supporting documents together with your application.

## Application fee
A fee of $1000 (non-refundable) for application for Transfer of Registration (i.e. fee includes $15 name application and $985 Transfer of Registration). A fee of $200 (non-refundable) for each application for Extension of Time under section 359(7), Part XA of the Companies Act applies. The payment details and instructions will be guided as part of the transaction.

## Processing time
It may take up to 2 months from the date of submission of all required documentation, to process the transfer of registration application. This includes the time required for referral to another government agency for approval or review.

## After Registration
The applicant will receive an email from ACRA on the outcome of the application. Upon approval of the application, the entity will be registered as a company limited by shares in Singapore. Once the foreign corporate entity is registered as a company in Singapore, a document evidencing deregistration of the foreign corporate entity in its place of incorporation must be submitted within 60 days after the date of registration.

## Application for Extension of Time to submit document
If the application to transfer registration is successful, a document to prove the deregistration in the place of incorporation must be submitted within 60 days after the date of registration in Singapore.

If the company requires more time to provide the document, the company may apply for an extension of time by submitting the "Application for Extension of Time to Submit Document Evidencing Deregistration in Place of Incorporation" form.

Each application costs $200 (non-refundable) and is valid for 60 days. All applications are subjected to approval.

The Registrar may revoke the registration of the company if the document is not submitted within 60 days after the date of registration, or within such longer period as the Registrar has approved.

### Things to note:
Companies should also register their pre-existing charges with ACRA within 30 days after the date of registration. Companies should deliver new share/debenture certificates to their holders within 60 days after the date of registration. Share warrants issued before the date of registration are void. Additionally, if the foreign corporate entity was registered as a foreign company under the Companies Act before re-domiciliation, the foreign company registration will cease.

# Striking off an LLP

This chapter provides an overview on closing an LLP through striking off.

## Overview: Strike Off Journey of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)

You may wish to close the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) for various reasons. One of the options available is to strike off the name of the LLP from the register.

As a partner, you may apply to ACRA to strike off the LLP’s name from the register. ACRA may approve the application if there is reasonable cause to believe that the LLP is not carrying on business and the LLP is able to satisfy the following criteria for striking off.

Please ensure that the LLP meets all the above criteria before you apply for striking off. An application made without satisfying these criteria could constitute a false declaration and may warrant an investigation.

### Note:
Please ensure that there is no outstanding tax credit owing to the LLP before applying for striking off. When the LLP is dissolved, any tax credit due to the LLP will be paid over to the Insolvency & Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO). The partners of the defunct LLP may approach IPTO if they wish to claim the tax credit. Please note that IPTO may impose charges for the processing of the claim.

## Who can apply for striking off
Only the LLP partners can apply to strike off the LLP. You may also engage a Corporate Service Provider to file on your behalf.

## How to apply for striking off
The application is to be made online via Bizfile using Singpass or Corppass.

Login to Bizfile and navigate to the "Apply to strike off business entity" eService. No filing fee or supporting documents are required for this transaction.

### Important: Before you apply

## What to expect after filing the application - The Strike Off Process
The entire strike off process may take at least 3 months after the application is approved.

a) Once the application is approved, ACRA may send a striking off letter to the LLP’s registered office address, its partners and managers

b) If there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the LLP in the Government Gazette. This is known as the First Gazette Notification.

c) After 60 days from the First Gazette Notification, if there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the LLP in the Government Gazette and the name of the LLP will be struck off the register. The date that the LLP is struck off will be stated. This is known as the Final Gazette Notification.

### Important: Understand the Difference Between Application Approval and Successful Strike Off

## Overview: Objection Process

## Who can object and How to lodge an Objection Against Striking Off
Any interested person can submit an objection application against a striking off application through Bizfile. There is no fee payable for this transaction.

When submitting an objection, you are required to state the reason(s) for objection and upload the supporting documents for ACRA to review the objection. Objection without supporting documents may be rejected. ACRA may request for further documents/ information (if required) to facilitate the review.

**Example of Supporting documents (non-exhaustive):**

If the objection is approved, ACRA will send a letter to inform the LLP of the objection. The letter will indicate the objector’s name and the objection reason. The LLP is given 2 months to resolve the matter. If the LLP is unable to resolve the matter within 2 months and the objection is not cleared, the striking off application will lapse. The LLP can only submit a new application after the objection has been cleared.

### Note:

## Clearance of an Objection to Striking Off
The person who objects to the striking off application must log in to Bizfile to clear the objection within 2 months from the objection lodgement date, before ACRA can proceed to continue with the striking off process. There is no fee payable for this transaction.

# Converting a Limited Partnership

## Summary

The provided HTML content contains information about converting a Limited Partnership (LP) in Singapore, managed by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).

**Page Currency Status:** The page is **NOT** last updated within one month from the current date.

**Reason:** The page footer contains a date string "2024/12/09", and a separate section shows "2025/02/26". Both dates are in the past relative to the current date (2025-04-11), and neither is within the last month. Therefore, the core informational content of the page does not meet the user's requirement of being updated within the last month.

**Available (Outdated) Content Overview:**
The page outlines requirements and processes for converting an LP, including:
*   Conversion of an LP to a business and restoration of LP registration.
*   Conversion of an LP from a "Regulation 12" to a "non-Regulation 12" status if it can no longer meet the specific conditions for the former.

Since the informational content is not from the required time period, no detailed summary of the conversion procedures is provided.

# Registration of Charge for VCC

**Page Last Updated Status:** The page is **not** last updated within one month from the current date. The latest date found on the page is 2025/07/04 (in the footer), which is in the future relative to the current date. Another date, 2025/02/26, is also in the future.

## Registration of Charge
Businesses may need to raise money in the course of its operation. When a VCC or sub-fund applies for a loan from a bank or other institutions, it will often give security to the creditor. One common form of security is a **charge** over assets.

## Definition of a Charge
A charge is a form of security interest usually taken by a lender or creditor (“chargee”) to secure repayment of a loan.

## Types of Charges

| Fixed Charge | A charge secured on fixed assets (e.g. land and buildings, a ship, piece of machinery, shares, intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc.) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Floating Charge | A charge secured on non-specific assets or generic categories (e.g. inventory, cash, stocks, accounts receivable). A floating charge ‘floats’ over the secured assets. It is only converted into a fixed charge if, for example, the company fails to repay the loan. |

## Registering a New Charge
When a charge is created for a VCC/sub-fund, it must be registered with ACRA.
The following charges must be registered:
The full list of charges and rules governing registration of charges can be found in sections 131 to 141 of Division 8 of the Companies Act as applied by section 42 of the VCC Act.

## Who Must Register
All VCCs and their sub-funds incorporated / registered in Singapore may register charges.

## When To Register
A charge must be registered within 30 days of its creation.

## How To Register
Engage the services of a corporate service provider (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit the Registration of Charge on behalf of the VCC. VCC officers (i.e. Directors and Secretaries) may submit the filing via

## After Registering
After registration, ACRA will send an email notification confirming the registration of the charge. The email notification serves as evidence that the VCC has complied with the requirements.

## Possible Outcomes of Late Registration
Failure to register the charge is an offence. If convicted, VCC officers may be fined up to $1,000. Non-compliance may also render the charge void against the liquidator or other secured creditors of the VCC.

## Charges in Singapore
Extension of time is **not** allowed for charge instruments created in Singapore. If the VCC or sub-fund did not register the charge **within 30 days**, the VCC or sub-fund will have to obtain a Court Order, and register the charge within the period granted by the Court.

## Charges Outside Singapore
Extension of time is allowed for charge instruments created outside of Singapore. If the VCC or sub-fund did not register the charge **within 37 days**, the VCC or sub-fund will have to obtain a Court Order. Once an extension of time is granted, the VCC is given up to **3 months** to register the charge.

## Variation of Charge
A variation of charge is an agreement to vary the terms of the original charge that was registered earlier (e.g. the amount secured or change in chargee). This transaction will be available later this year. No fee is payable for this transaction.

## Satisfaction of Charge
When a debt has been paid up in whole or in part, the VCC needs to file with ACRA a statement of satisfaction of the debt in order to release the charge. Upon successful filing, the charge will be removed from the Register.
VCCs may engage a corporate service provider to assist in filing the Satisfaction of Charge. There is no filing fee for this transaction.

# Directors Duties in relation to Financial Reporting

## Introduction
Quality financial information is crucial for strong and vibrant markets. More than ever, investors, suppliers, financial institutions, customers, company directors, corporate executives and many more are asking for reliable and timely financial statements in order to obtain a more accurate picture of the business, whether in terms of generating value or understanding the risks involved.

Over the past decade, businesses have also become more challenging and business models more complex. To cope with them, financial reporting standards have become increasingly complex and require more professional judgement on the part of the preparers of financial statements. Examples include the accounting for business acquisitions, the fair value measurement of assets and revenue recognition of multi-element transactions.

It is essential that the market remains confident in the level of transparency, integrity and quality of financial reporting. In response to this, ACRA has commenced a Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme to enforce against poor financial reporting that leads to unreliable information and/or non-compliance with the prescribed accounting standards.

## Companies Act requirements
All Singapore (SG) incorporated companies are required to prepare financial statements (FS) except for dormant relevant companies as defined under section 201A of the Companies Act (the Act). Under sections 201(2) and 201(5) of the Act, directors are responsible to present and lay before the company, at its annual general meeting, financial statements that:

In addition, directors of a SG incorporated company are responsible to maintain a system of internal accounting controls and keep proper accounting and other records that will enable the preparation of true and fair financial statements under sections 199(2A) and 199(1) of the Act, respectively.

## Guidance to directors in carrying out these financial reporting duties
The above is meant to guide directors in complying with certain significant duties in relation to financial reporting. They do not exhaustively define the duties applicable to directors under the Act and/or related legislation. When in doubt, legal advice should be sought by directors to clarify the scope of their duties.

# Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme

## Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme

High-quality financial reporting is important for building trust in our capital market and economy. Financial reporting is a requirement for all entities in Singapore's financial ecosystem, including local companies and foreign entities listed on the Singapore Exchange. ACRA conducts financial reporting surveillance of these entities in order to maintain high financial reporting standard, protect investors and uphold market integrity.

**(A) Singapore-incorporated Companies**

Directors are responsible for preparing and tabling annual financial statements in compliance with the prescribed accounting standards in Singapore (Sections 201(2) and 201(5) of the Companies Act). A set of financial statements that complies with the accounting standards will provide reliable and comparable information to the stakeholders for decision-making.

As the regulator of companies, ACRA enquires with the directors where it appears that the financial statements are not compliant with the accounting standards through the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme (FRSP).

Where ACRA finds non-compliance with the accounting standards, ACRA will issue findings letters to inform directors of the non-compliance and encourage them to take note in the preparation of future financial statements. Where necessary, ACRA may seek remediation actions from the company, such as revision of past financial statements. In more serious instances of non-compliance, ACRA may issue warning letters, impose composition sums against the directors, or even prosecute the directors, to deter potential offenders.

We also work with professional bodies to build the competency of directors and preparers of financial statements.

**(B) Other Listed Issuers**

From 26 August 2025, ACRA includes other listed issuers such as business trusts, real estate investment trusts and foreign-incorporated companies in its financial reporting surveillance for compliance with the accounting standards. This enhances regulatory oversight to maintain market integrity and investor confidence across all entities raising funds from the public in Singapore.

When reviewing these issuers' financial statements, ACRA may:

Where material non-compliances with accounting standards are identified, ACRA may share this information with MAS and SGX RegCo for their assessment of potential breaches under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and the Listing Rules, respectively.

For more details on the regulatory framework and inter-agency cooperation, please refer to the MAS Enforcement Monograph.

### Reporting to the Public

To enhance transparency, we publish reports summarising the activities and findings of the FRSP. These reports aim to help companies avoid the common pitfalls and improve their financial reporting by enhancing their understanding of the application and interpretation of the Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Act.

### Financial Reporting Resources for Companies and Directors

The Companies Act (the Act) imposes specific obligations on all directors of Singapore incorporated companies, regardless of their role or financial expertise, regarding financial reporting. These responsibilities, particularly under section 201(2) and 201(5) of the Act, require directors to ensure that their company presents financial statements that comply with prescribed accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance.

To guide directors and other financial statements preparers, we publish Financial Reporting Practice Guidance highlighting the areas of the FRSP’s review focus for the coming year. This will remind directors of the risks of misstatements in the financial statements as well as how to better meet the information needs of investors and other users of financial statements.

# Registering a Charge for Companies
Requirement and procedures for lodging charges of a company with ACRA

Businesses may need to raise money in the course of its operations. When a company applies for a loan from a bank or other institutions, it will often give security to the creditor. One common form of security is a **charge** over assets.

## Definition of a Charge
A charge is a form of security interest usually taken by a lender or creditor (“chargee”) to secure repayment of a loan.

## Types of Charges

| Fixed Charge | A charge secured on fixed assets (e.g. land and buildings, a ship, piece of machinery, shares, intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, trade marks, etc.) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Floating Charge | A charge secured on non-specific assets or generic categories (e.g. inventory, cash, stocks, accounts receivable).<br><br>A floating charge ‘floats’ over the secured assets. It is only converted into a fixed charge if, for example, the company fails to repay the loan. |

## Registering a New Charge
When a charge is created, it must be registered with ACRA.

The following charges must be registered:

The full list of charges and rules governing registration of charges can be found in

## Who Must Register
Registering a charge applies to **all** Singapore-registered local and foreign companies.

## When to Register
A charge must be registered **within 30 days of its creation**.

## How to Register
Engage the services of a corporate service provider (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on the company’s behalf. Company Officers may submit the filing. Alternatively, the company director may submit the filing.

## After Registering
Application will be processed and approved after submission. ACRA will send an email notification confirming the registration of the charge. The email notification will serve as conclusive evidence that the company has complied with the requirements.

## Possible Outcomes of Late Registration
Failure to register the charge is an offence. If convicted, company officers may be fined **up to S$1,000**. Non-compliance may also render the charge void against the liquidator or other secured creditors of the company.

## Charge Created in Singapore
Extension of time is **not** allowed for charge instruments created in Singapore. If the company did not register the charge **within 30 days**, the company will have to obtain a Court Order under section 137 of the Companies Act for the time for registration to be extended, and register the charge within the extended period of time granted by the Court.

## Charge Created Outside Singapore
Extension of time is allowed for charge instruments created **outside** Singapore. If the company did not register the charge **within 37 days**, the company will have to apply to ACRA under section 139 of the Companies Act for an extension of time to register the charge. ACRA will grant an extension of time of **30 days** for the company to register the charge.

## Variation of Charge
A variation of charge is an agreement to vary the terms of the original charge (e.g. a variation of the amount secured or the chargee). The transaction must be done through

## Satisfaction of Charge
When a debt for which the charge was given has been paid in whole or in part, the company needs to file with ACRA via

Companies may engage a corporate service provider to assist in filing the statement of satisfaction ('Satisfaction of Charge') with ACRA. There is no filing fee for this transaction.

## Summary

This page presents key findings from the 2025 Accounting Entities (AE) Survey and announces upcoming enhancements to the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification (SCAQ).

### (A) ACRA’s Accounting Entities Survey 2025

Three key findings emerged from the annual national survey, based on 2024 statistics (233 respondents, representing 92% of the sector's revenue):

1.  **Revenue growth across all segments:** The accountancy sector recorded a 7.5% revenue growth in 2024, reaching approximately $3.5 billion. Growth was driven primarily by Audit and Assurance services and observed across all firm sizes.

2.  **Resident workforce posts its first growth since 2020:** The sector's workforce grew by about 200 positions (+0.9%), driven by an expansion of over 1,300 resident positions (+8.8%). Wages increased for experienced roles (senior associates, managers, directors), and more entry-level graduates secured higher salaries. The sector expects to offer over 1,500 career opportunities.

3.  **Future-focused skills development:** The top skillsets AEs aim to build are:
    *   Advanced data analytics and visualisation (41%)
    *   Sustainability assurance (28%)
    *   Sustainability reporting (27%)
    *   Risk management and governance (27%)

ACRA will curate sustainability reporting training with SkillsFuture Singapore to prepare professionals for new climate-related disclosure requirements effective from FY2025.

2.  **Curriculum refresh of Professional Programme:** The curriculum will be updated to include ESG frameworks and technology-focused topics (cybersecurity, data governance). The new curriculum launches in June 2026 and applies from the December 2026 examinations.

3.  **Assessment format changes for Foundation Programme:** The assessment format will change from written essays to multiple-choice questions from 2026, aligning with international practices and allowing for more frequent exam sessions.

# Striking Off a Local Company

**Page Last Updated Status:** The page contains a date reference of "2025/02/26". Based on a current date assumption, this information is **NOT last updated within one month from the current date**.

## Overview: Strike Off Journey of a Company
![Strike Off Journey Diagram](/images/default-source/default-album/lc-so22aa8533-14bb-42a4-b9f6-23545325b948.png?sfvrsn=1c7f866_1)

## Check the striking off criteria
You may wish to close the company for various reasons. One of the options available is to strike off the name of the company from the register.

As a director, you may apply to ACRA to strike off the company's name from the register. ACRA may approve the application if there is reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business and the company is able to satisfy the criteria for striking off.

Please ensure that the company meets all the criteria before you apply for striking off. An application made without satisfying these criteria could constitute a false declaration and may warrant an investigation.

### Important: Outstanding Tax Credit
NOTE: Please ensure that there is no outstanding tax credit owing to the company before applying for striking off. When the company is dissolved, any tax credit due to the company will be paid over to the Insolvency & Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO). The shareholders of the defunct company may approach IPTO if they wish to claim the tax credit. Please note that IPTO may impose charges for the processing of the claim.

## Who can apply for striking off
Only the company officers (directors or company secretary) can apply to strike off the company. You may also engage a Corporate Service Provider to file on your behalf.

## How to apply for striking off
The application is to be made online via Bizfile using Singpass or Corppass.

### Important: Before you apply

## What to expect after filing the application - The Strike Off Process
The entire strike off process may take at least 3 months after the application is approved.

a) Once the application is approved, ACRA may send a striking off letter to the company’s registered office address, its officers (such as director, company secretary and shareholder) at their address in our records and to IRAS and CPFB.

b) If there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the company in the Government Gazette. This is known as the First Gazette Notification.

c) After 60 days from the First Gazette Notification, if there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the company in the Government Gazette and the name of the company will be struck off the register. The date that the company is struck off will be stated. This is known as the Final Gazette Notification.

### Important: Understand the Difference Between Application Approval and Successful Strike Off

## Overview: Objection Process
![Objection Process Diagram](/images/default-source/default-album/lc-obj.png?sfvrsn=9928bb5e_1)

## Who can object and How to lodge an objection against striking off
Any interested person can submit an objection against a striking off application.

When submitting an objection, you are required to state the reason(s) for objection and upload the supporting documents for ACRA to review the objection. Objection without supporting documents may be rejected. ACRA may request for further documents/ information (if required) to facilitate the review.

**Example of Supporting documents (non-exhaustive):**

If the objection is approved, ACRA will send a letter to inform the company of the objection. The letter will indicate the objector’s name and the objection reason. The company is given 2 months to resolve the matter. If the company is unable to resolve the matter within 2 months and the objection is not cleared, the striking off application will lapse. The company can only submit a new application after the objection has been cleared.

### Note:

## Clearance of an Objection to Striking Off
The person who objects to the striking off application must log in to Bizfile to clear the objection within 2 months from the objection lodgement date, before ACRA can proceed to continue with the striking off process. There is no fee payable for this transaction.

## Withdrawal of Striking Off Application
A company can apply for withdrawal of its application for striking off. There is no filing fee for this transaction.

## Restoration - After a Company has been struck off
A company can be restored within 6 years after the company's name has been struck off, by a Court Order. The Court Order must be lodged.

All companies that are “Live” on ACRA’s register are required to fulfil statutory obligations including filing of Annual Returns.

# New Business Profile API available from 18 Nov 2025

**Category:** Announcement
**Date:** 13 Nov 2025

**Summary:**
A new Business Profile Application Programming Interface (API) will be launched on 18 November 2025 as part of ongoing enhancements.

**What is Business Profile API?**
The Business Profile API provides seamless access to essential business entity information in a convenient API format. The information provided, such as Unique Entity Number (UEN), entity name, business activities, date of incorporation or registration, and details of position holders, business owners, or partners, is the same information found in the Business Profile report available through BizFile.

**Why use Business Profile API?**
For organisations requiring regular access to business entity information, such as multiple business profiles, the API provides automated, real-time access. Instead of individual manual searches, organisations can access a larger volume of business profiles through a single integration, helping to streamline workflows.

**Who should use the Business Profile API?**
The API is suitable for users in industries and professions requiring regular access to business entity information.

**Get started**
The API will be available from 18 Nov 2025.

**Page Last Updated Status:**
The page's primary content date is 13 Nov 2025. Based on a current date assumption, this information is **NOT from within the last month**. The page includes other timestamps (e.g., 2025/02/26, 2024/05/17) which are also not from the last month.

# Changes on statutory requirements for AGM and filing of AR

As part of on-going efforts to keep Singapore business friendly and competitive, legislative changes relating to Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and Annual Returns (ARs) timelines that will reduce the regulatory burden of companies took effect on 31 Aug 2018.

The following legislative amendments to the Companies Act took effect for companies with FYE ending on or after 31 August 2018.

## Alignment of timelines for holding AGMs and filing ARs to the Financial Year End (FYE)

To provide greater clarity for companies and reduce the compliance burden, the timelines for holding Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and the filing of annual returns will be aligned with the company’s FYE.

### Timeline for holding AGMs and filing of annual returns

| For Companies with FYE ending before 31 Aug 2018 | For Companies with FYE ending on or after 31 Aug 2018 |
| :--- | :--- |
| ***Holding of AGMs*** | |
| (a) Timeline 1: Hold first AGM within 18 months of incorporation, and subsequent AGMs yearly at intervals of not more than 15 months <br> (b) Timeline 2: Financial statements tabled at AGM must be made up to a date within 4 months (for listed company) or 6 months (for any other company) before the AGM date. | **For listed companies:** <br> Hold AGM within 4 months after FYE <br><br> **For any other company:** <br> Hold AGM within 6 months after FYE |
| ***Filing of Annual Returns*** | |
| **For companies having a share capital and keeping a branch register outside Singapore** <br><br> **For other companies** | **For companies having a share capital and keeping a branch register outside Singapore:** <br><br> **For other companies:** <br><br> Annual return can be filed only: |

To prevent companies from arbitrarily changing their FYE, the following safeguards are put in place:

#### A company’s financial periods starting on or after 31 Aug 2018 by default will be taken to be a period of 12 months for each financial period.

### Important information for companies with unusual financial year period

Companies with an unusual financial year period (e.g. 52 weeks) should notify ACRA via the notification of change of FYE if they want to avoid applying for approval to change FYE every year.

### Important information for newly Incorporated companies that have yet to file Annual Returns

Companies incorporated before 31 August 2018 have their FYE deemed by law to be the anniversary of the date previously notified to the Registrar as their FYE date. In the absence of such notification before 31 August 2018, the anniversary of the date of incorporation is deemed by law to be their FYE. Companies can change their FYE by notifying ACRA before or after 31 August 2018.

#### Illustrative timelines of AGM and AR obligations

### Illustrative examples relating to Change of FYE

| |
| :--- |
| **Effect of new law on existing company’s FYE** (“existing company” refers to a company incorporated before 31 Aug 2018) <br><br> **Example 1**: Company has indicated in its AR previously filed with ACRA that its FYE is 31 Mar 2018. <br> The company’s next FYE is deemed by the new law to be 31 Mar 2019. <br> <br> **Example 2**: Company was incorporated on 1 Jan 2018 and has not yet lodged any AR with ACRA. <br> The company’s first FYE is deemed by the new law to be 1 Jan 2019. <br><br> **Effect of new law on new company’s FYE** (“new company” refers to a company incorporated on or after 31 Aug 2018) <br><br> **Example 3**: Company is incorporated on 1 Jan 2019. The company must notify the Registrar of its FYE upon incorporation. |
| <br> **What an existing company needs to do to change its FYE** <br><br> Company has indicated in its AR previously filed with ACRA that its FYE is 31 Mar 2018. FYE deemed by law is 31 Mar 2019. <br> <br> What should the company do to change its FYE? <br><br> **Restrictions on change in FYE for companies with FYE ending on or after 31 Aug 2018 for a change made on or after 31 Aug 2018** <br><br> (a) A company cannot change its FYE without Registrar’s approval: <br><br> **Example 1** <br> Company’s FYE deemed by the new law is 31 Mar 2019 <br> <br> On 31 Jul 2018, company wants to change its FYE to 30 Apr 2019 <br><br> On 31 Dec 2020, company wants to change its FYE to 1 Feb 2021 <br><br> **Example 2** <br><br> Company’s FYE deemed by the new law is 31 Mar 2019 <br> On 31 Jan 2019, company wants to change its FYE to 30 Apr 2019 <br><br> On 31 Dec 2020, company wants to change its FYE to 1 Feb 2021 <br><br> **Example 3** <br><br> Company indicated in its AR filed in 2019 that its previous FY ended on 31 Mar 2019. Its next FYE should be 31 Mar 2020. <br> On 31 Jan 2020, company wants to change its FYE to 31 Dec 2020. <br><br> (b) FYE can be changed for previous or current financial year, but only if the deadline for the holding of AGM, filing of AR or sending of financial statements for the current financial year have not yet passed. <br><br> **Example 4** <br><br> Company’s FYE notified in AR last filed with ACRA is 31 Mar 2021. Its next FYE should be 31 Mar 2022. <br> On 10 Nov 2025, company wants to change its FYE for 2022 from 31 Mar 2022 to 31 Dec 2022. <br><br> **Example 5** <br><br> Company indicated in its AR filed in 2019 that its previous FY ended on 31 Mar 2019. Its next FYE should be 31 Mar 2020.<br> On 1 Dec 2020, company wants to change its FYE from 31 Mar 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. |

## Exemption for private companies from holding AGMs subject to specified safeguards

Under the Companies (Amendment) Act 2017, private companies are exempted from holding AGMs if they send their financial statements to members within 5 months after the FYE.
The following safeguards are put in place:

### Private dormant relevant companies

Private dormant relevant companies exempt from preparing financial statements do not need to hold AGM, subject to the above-mentioned safeguards.

**A Private Dormant Relevant Company is a private company which is dormant; is not listed (or not a subsidiary of a listed company); and has total assets less than or equal to $500,000 (consolidated value if it is an ultimate parent).**

![Companies filing timelines](/images/default-source/default-album/legislation/companies-act-reform/companies-(amendment)-act-2017/companies_agmtimelines.png?sfvrsn=da150fba_2)

### Private companies can continue to dispense with holding of AGMs

Private companies need not hold AGMs if all members have approved a resolution to dispense with the holding of AGMs. The timelines differ according to the companies' FYE. This is for consistency with the alignment of timelines for holding AGMs and filing ARs to the Financial Year End (for companies with FYE ending on or after 31 Aug 2018) .

| For companies with FYE ending before 31 Aug 2018 | For companies with FYE ending on or after 31 Aug 2018 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Annual Return is due within 30 days after the date financial statements are sent or the date on which all resolutions by written means were passed, whichever is later | **Annual Return is due within 7 months after FYE** |
| A member may request for AGM not later than 3 months before year end | **A member may request for AGM not later than 14 days before the last day of the 6th month after FYE** |
| If the dispensation resolution ceases to be in force, AGM must be held if there is at least 3 months of the year remaining from the time the resolution ceases to have effect | **If the dispensation resolution ceases to be in force, AGM must be held if at least 3 months remain to the AGM due date** |

**Where AGM is held after annual return is filed (due to member request), the new notification of the AGM date must be filed with the Registrar within 14 days.**

A private company which sends out its financial statements within 5 months after FYE may proceed to file its annual return with ACRA. If the company subsequently receives a valid request from a member to hold AGM, it must lodge a notice with the Registrar of the date of the AGM held.

## Audit Regulation
An independent auditor's report enhances the credibility and reliability of an entity's financial statements. The report states whether the financial statements comply with financial reporting standards, and are true and fair, based on the auditor's evaluation of the evidence obtained during the audit process.

In Singapore, only public accountants practising in accounting entities approved by ACRA may provide an audit opinion on financial statements.

Through its independent oversight of public accountants and accounting entities, ACRA enables a high degree of confidence in Singapore's audited financial information.

## Practice Monitoring Programme (PMP) and Quality Control (QC) Reviews
Under the PMP, ACRA inspects audits performed by public accountants to assess if they have complied with the professional standards (i.e. Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs) and/or other requirements) when rendering public accountancy services.

## Anti-Money Laundering / Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Requirements Reviews
Under the AML/CFT requirements reviews, ACRA assesses the compliance with the AML/CFT requirements by accounting entities and public accountants. The AML/CFT requirements refer to the prescribed requirements relating to the detection and prevention of money laundering or the financing terrorism by public accountants and accounting entities.

## Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities
All registered public accountants must adhere to the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) prescribed by the Public Accountants Oversight Committee. A breach of the ACRA Code constitutes grounds for disciplinary proceedings under the Accountants Act.

# Overview of ACRA

The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) is the regulator of business registration, financial reporting, public accountants, and corporate service providers. We are also responsible for developing the accountancy sector and setting the accounting standards for companies, charities, co-operative societies, and societies in Singapore. ACRA fosters a vibrant and trusted business environment that enables innovation and growth and contributes towards making Singapore the best place for business.

ACRA was formed as a statutory board on 1 April 2004, following the merger of the Registry of Companies and Businesses (RCB) and the Public Accountants' Board (PAB). This merger sought to achieve synergies between the monitoring of corporate compliance with disclosure requirements and the regulation of public accountants performing statutory audits.

On 1 April 2023, ACRA, the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) and the Accounting Standards Council (ASC) merged as one entity, taking on the name, ACRA. The merger aimed to strengthen the effectiveness of regulation, standards-setting, and sector development by harnessing synergies across complementary accountancy-related functions.

## ACRA's Vision, Mission, Corporate Goals and Values

**Vision:**
Singapore: The Best Place for Business

**Mission:**
Foster a vibrant and trusted business environment that enables innovation and growth

**Corporate goals:**
ACRA's four corporate goals:

**Core values:**
ACRA's core values, guide us in all that we do:

## Responsibilities of ACRA

ACRA is responsible for, inter alia, the following functions:

## ACRA's Data Policy Statement

As the national business registry of Singapore, one of ACRA’s functions is to establish and administer a repository of documents and information relating to business entities and public accountants, and to provide access to the public to such documents and information.

This is to facilitate trade and interactions among businesses and members of the public, enhance transparency and enable the public to conduct due diligence checks on these entities and the people who operate them.

Most of the information lodged with ACRA via Bizfile, ACRA’s on-line registry system, can be accessed by the public upon payment of a fee. Some of the information can also be obtained from ACRA’s authorised Information Service Providers (ISPs).

### Information for Public Access

The information available for public access includes registration date, nature of business activity, registered office address and financial statements of business entities, as well as personal data about owners, shareholders, directors and officers of the business. The types of personal data publicly available are:

Holders of personal data obtained through ACRA's system or from authorised ISPs are responsible for making sure that they comply with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and other laws, regarding the disclosure and use of personal data and information. Should the use of information by anyone constitute an offence or a breach of the law, he or she may face legal action or criminal prosecution.

ACRA is exempted from the PDPA. The ACRA Act provides for ACRA to disclose personal data in discharging its functions. Nevertheless, ACRA adheres to the Public Sector (Governance) Act and Government Instruction Manuals with respect to the way data is managed. This includes putting in place processes and procedures to prevent disclosure of data under circumstances other than those allowed under the ACRA Act.

ACRA will continue to keep abreast of industry standards and strive to implement best practices where applicable, with respect to the way we manage personal data.

## ACRA’s Environmental Sustainability Policy Statement

**ACRA is committed to promoting environmental sustainability and recognises that the way we deliver our service and perform our regulatory role has an impact on the environment.**

To deliver on our commitment, we will:

**Incorporate environmentally sustainable practices in the way we deliver service and interact with stakeholders**

We will facilitate digital engagements with users of our services and with those we regulate and partner with, and influence businesses to adopt environmentally sustainable practices.

**Work with stakeholders to shape the corporate reporting landscape for sustainability-related information**

We recognise that environmental sustainability is both an opportunity and a risk, and businesses can demonstrate their impact on sustainability through corporate reporting. We will work with stakeholders to consider the reporting and assurance requirements for sustainability-related information, and how such information can contribute towards a trusted and vibrant business environment in Singapore.

**Minimise our environmental footprint and foster a culture of sustainability across our organisation**

We will track our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint through our procurement practice and usage of resources, in line with public sector sustainability commitments. We will also foster a culture of sustainability by encouraging and supporting our officers in embracing sustainable practices and making sustainability our way of life.

# ACRA Annual Reports

## Summary of Recent Updates

Based on the provided HTML content, the page contains a list of ACRA (Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) Annual Reports, with the most recent being the **Annual Report 2024-2025**.

The page includes two distinct "last updated" timestamps:
1.  **2025/02/26** - Found within a section related to the "Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority" and a news update sign-up form.
2.  **2025/09/29** - Found in the page footer.

**Is the page last updated one month from the current date?**
**No.** The most recent timestamp found in the content is **2025/09/29**. Assuming the current date is prior to August 29, 2025, this timestamp is in the future and not from one month ago. The other timestamp (**2025/02/26**) is also a future date. Therefore, based on the timestamps embedded in the page, it does not appear to have been updated within the last month from a current perspective before August 2025.

## Available Annual Reports
The main content lists downloadable annual reports in reverse chronological order:
*   Annual Report 2024-2025
*   Annual Report 2023-2024
*   Annual Report 2022-2023 (Includes a link for the Singapore Accountancy Commission report)
*   Annual Report 2021-2022 (Includes a link for the Singapore Accountancy Commission report)

A "Past Annual Reports" section lists reports from 2020-2021 back to 2006-2007, each typically with a cover thumbnail and a download link. Reports from 2020-2021 to 2013-2014 also include links for the corresponding Singapore Accountancy Commission Annual Report.

# Terms of Use

## Summary

The provided Terms of Use document does not contain a specific "last updated" date for its content. The only dates present in the HTML are in page footers or metadata (e.g., "2025/02/26", "2024/05/23"), which appear to be related to the website framework or copyright, not the revision date of the Terms of Use text itself.

**Conclusion:** It is **not possible to determine** if the page's Terms of Use information was last updated within one month from the current date, as the core content lacks a clear revision timestamp.

*The decrease in business cessation count in January 2025 was due to a suspension of ACRA’s periodic exercise to remove from the public register business entities that failed to renew their registrations and companies that were dormant.*

*The increase in the business cessation counts in February 2025 was due to the resumption of ACRA’s periodic exercise to remove from the public register business entities that failed to renew their registrations or that were dormant.*

*Fluctuations in the overall business cessation counts between March and August 2025 are attributed to timing shifts resulting from the migration of Bizfile to a new system. The numbers are expected to normalise from September 2025 onwards.*
