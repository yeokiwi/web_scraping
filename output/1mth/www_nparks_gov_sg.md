### AI Summary
The NACLAR Guidelines, established in 2003, outline mandatory requirements for animal research facilities in Singapore, including compliance with the guidelines, obtaining an AVS license, and allowing facility inspections. The guidelines are structured into four sections: Guiding Principles (promoting the 3Rs—Replacement, Reduction, Refinement), The IACUC (requiring institutions to establish committees for oversight and compliance), Training (mandating appropriate education for researchers and personnel), and Occupational Health and Safety (necessitating institution-specific safety programs aligned with legislation).
