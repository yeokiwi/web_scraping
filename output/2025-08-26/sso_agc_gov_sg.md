### AI Summary
The 2025 revised edition of the Human Biomedical Research (Requirements for Appropriate Consent — Exemption) Regulations 2019 introduces several key changes to consent requirements, primarily expanding exemptions from the need for a prescribed witness during consent. These include allowing witness-free consent for non-invasive, non-interventional research (including surveys), minimal-risk interventional research where subjects can read and sign consent forms, and tissue donations for therapeutic/diagnostic purposes not involving restricted research. It also clarifies retroactive exemptions for consent given before specific dates (e.g., November 2017 for research subjects, November 2019 for tissue donors) and eases consent rules for minors donating blood in national programs, provided they have sufficient understanding and give informed consent.
