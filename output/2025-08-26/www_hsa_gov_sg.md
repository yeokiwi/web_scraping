### AI Summary
This document outlines key changes to Singapore's controlled drugs licensing framework, with notable modifications including the introduction of distinct validity periods and application requirements for different product categories: diagnostic test kits now qualify for multi-consignment licenses valid for one year, while therapeutic products, active ingredients, reagents, and veterinary products remain restricted to single-consignment licenses valid for six months. Additionally, all license applications now require supplementary documentation specific to product type (e.g., medical device licenses for test kits, therapeutic product dealer licenses for pharmaceuticals) and must be submitted by a pharmacist registered with the Singapore Pharmacy Council.
