The document outlines key updates to Singapore's re-employment policies, effective from 1 July 2022, including an increase in the re-employment age from 67 to 68, with a further rise to 69 planned for 1 July 2026. It also introduces a revised Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) structure, allowing a reduced EAP of 2 months' salary (minimum $4,000, maximum $8,500) for employees re-employed for at least 30 months since age 63, while maintaining the standard EAP at 3.5 months' salary (minimum $6,250, maximum $14,750) for others. Additionally, the guidelines now encourage employers to adopt higher internal retirement and re-employment ages, implement structured career planning for employees aged 45 and above, use job redesign for age-friendly workplaces, and restructure medical benefits to include additional MediSave contributions or flexible benefits.
