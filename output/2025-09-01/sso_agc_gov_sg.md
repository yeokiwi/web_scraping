### AI Summary
The 2025 revised edition of the Human Biomedical Research (Requirements for Appropriate Consent — Exemption) Regulations 2019 introduces several key exemptions to the witness requirement for obtaining consent. Specifically, it removes the need for a prescribed witness for research that is non-invasive, non-interventional, and not restricted, including surveys or information collection; for interventional research with minimal risk where the subject can read and sign consent; and for tissue donors in therapeutic or diagnostic contexts or minimal-risk procedures, provided the donor can consent. It also exempts consent given before specific dates (e.g., November 2017 for research subjects, November 2019 for tissue donors) and waives certain information requirements for biological material or health information obtained before November 2018 if prior informed consent exists. Additionally, it allows minors aged 18 or older to consent independently for blood donation in research under national programs, bypassing the need for parental or guardian consent.
