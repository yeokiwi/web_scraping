Additionally, all licenses now require supplementary approvals (therapeutic product dealer's licenses, active ingredient importer's licenses, Form A Poisons Licenses, or medical device licenses) depending on the activity and product type, and wholesale licenses (CDWL) must be held by registered pharmacists and are renewable annually.
