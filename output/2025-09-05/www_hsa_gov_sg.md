### AI Summary
The document outlines key changes to licensing requirements for controlled drugs in Singapore, including that Controlled Drug Import Licences (CDIL) and Export Licences (CDEL) are now non-renewable and require new applications upon expiry, with validity periods adjusted to six months for most products (except diagnostic test kits, which allow multiple consignments and have a one-year validity). Additionally, applicants must hold specific supplementary licences (e.g., therapeutic product dealer’s, medical device importer’s, or Form A Poisons Licence) depending on the drug type and activity, and all licence holders for storage, wholesale, or manufacture must be registered pharmacists.
