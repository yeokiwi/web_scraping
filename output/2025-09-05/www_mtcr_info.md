### AI Summary
The MTCR Annex has been updated as of 25 April 2024, with the current version reflecting changes from the previous iteration, though the specific amendments are not detailed in this document. The MTCR Annex Handbook remains based on the 2016 version and is not an official MTCR publication. The core structure of the Annex continues to categorize items into Category I (subject to greatest restraint, including complete rocket systems exceeding 300km/500kg range/payload) and Category II (with more flexible treatment, covering systems with a range of at least 300km and dual-use technologies), maintaining the regime's focus on controlling missile-related equipment and technology while not impeding peaceful space programs.
